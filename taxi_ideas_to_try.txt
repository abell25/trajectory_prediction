======================

Local testability:
[X] Create a test set and verify it's CV is similar to the leaderboard 
   * the test set seems like there are shorter trips..

# 1. Trip Features
(These can generate path features that we will feed directly into a ML algorithm)

Start/End priors
[ ] Build a simple model Pr(end|begining) using k-nn for prediction
[ ] run clustering algorithm to find most common points (or round to 3?) and generate Pr(end|curr) matrix

Trip "fingerprint"
[ ] Create a histogram of coordinates
   [ ] Run k-means first to reduce the dimensionality of this procedure
   


# 2. Model-based classification 
(We will attempt to model the dynamics of the system)

Markov model
[ ] Build a graph where you map each coord transition.  Approximate this model with a Markov Model


# 3. Sequence-distance
(Find similar paths using sequence matching techniques
[ ] index paths by a grid over the map, to reduce the number of comparisons for DTW (or any path comparison technique)
